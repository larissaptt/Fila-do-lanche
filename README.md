<h1>Snack time / Hora do lanche</h1>
<p>Code created in the classroom, with the aim of understanding how an algorithm works.<br>
Using as an example the moment when there is lunch, where students stand in line, an adult scans the QR code on the card and thus allows the student to get the food.<br>
To create this code, functions were defined for each 'question', making the code work correctly and without errors.<br>
considering the fact that defining functions is faster and more practical, at least for me.</p>
